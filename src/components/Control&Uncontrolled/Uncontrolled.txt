** Uncontrolled Components **

Components that keep track of their own states and release data
only when some event occurs. (That is, the submit event for HTML forms).

        eg:

    const MyComponent = ({onSubmit}) => {
        const [ someState, setState ] = useState(...)

        return ...
    }


** Control Components **
Components that do not keep track of their own state -- all state is passed in as
props ( that is, when we use the useState hook with the text inputs).
